# Extracting Readable Strings from a Binary Using the strings Command

## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to use the strings command to extract human-readable text from a binary file. The goal was to identify URLs, IP addresses, commands, or other meaningful indicators. For this assignment, the binary used was plink.exe.

## Tools Used
- Kali Linux Terminal
- strings command
- grep command
- plink.exe sample binary

## Steps Followed

### Step 1: Selecting the Binary File
A safe Windows executable named plink.exe was selected for static analysis.  
This file is available in Kali Linux under:
```
/usr/share/windows-resources/malware/
```
 
 



### Step 2: Running strings on plink.exe
The main strings extraction was performed using:
```
strings plink.exe
```

 

This displayed all readable content embedded inside the binary, including:
- DLL names
- API functions
- System paths
- Network strings
- Command keywords



### Step 3: Extracting URLs
To identify URLs or web-related strings, the following command was run:
```
strings plink.exe | grep -Ei "http|https|www"
```
 
 

From this output, readable **URL patterns were successfully extracted**, confirming that the file contained references to network resources.



### Step 4: Extracting IP Addresses
To detect embedded IPv4 addresses inside the binary, the regex below was used:
```
strings plink.exe | grep -Eo "([0-9]{1,3}.){3}[0-9]{1,3}"
```
 
 

This command successfully extracted **IP address patterns** present in the binary.



### Step 5: Detecting Suspicious Commands
To search for command-line related keywords commonly used by executables, the command below was used:
```
strings plink.exe | grep -Ei "cmd|powershell|copy|del|start|run"
```


This produced multiple **suspicious command references**, such as command-line usage, execution functions, or internal operations.



## Summary of Findings
Using the strings tool on plink.exe, the following indicators were successfully extracted:

- URLs embedded inside the binary
- IP address patterns
- Suspicious command references such as `cmd`, `start`, and `run`
- Windows API function names
- DLL import references
- Configuration and path strings

These findings demonstrate how readable strings in an executable can reveal useful information about its functionality or potential behavior, even without executing it.

## Conclusion
In this assignment, the strings utility was used to perform static analysis of plink.exe. URLs, IP addresses, and suspicious command keywords were extracted successfully. This shows how the strings command is an essential tool for initial malware analysis, enabling analysts to uncover important indicators from a binary file without executing it.
