#  Threat Analysis of a Suspicious Executable

## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to perform a static analysis of a suspicious executable using a cloud sandbox environment. The focus was specifically on examining extracted ASCII strings and reviewing the threat classification generated by the sandbox.

## Tools Used
- Hybrid Analysis (https://www.hybrid-analysis.com)
- reverse_https_8080 executable (test sample generated earlier)

## Steps Followed

### Step 1: Uploading the Executable
The reverse_https_8080 file was uploaded to Hybrid Analysis for automated analysis.  
The sandbox scanned the sample and generated a detailed static report.



### Step 2: Extracted ASCII Strings
Hybrid Analysis extracted readable ASCII strings from the executable.  
These strings included:

- Windows API references  
- Basic metadata  
- General function names  
- Encoded or partial text segments  

These strings help identify the internal components and capabilities of a binary without executing it.



### Step 3: Threat Classification
Hybrid Analysis assigned an automated malicious score based on internal static indicators present in the file.  
The platform flagged the sample due to characteristics commonly seen in remote-connective executables.


## Summary of Findings
The analysis provided two important insights:

1. Extracted ASCII strings revealed internal components and functions used by the executable.  
2. The threat classification labeled the sample as malicious based on static indicators.  

This confirms that even without executing a file, static analysis can provide useful information about its intended behavior.

## Conclusion
This assignment demonstrated how to analyze a suspicious executable using static methods inside a sandbox. By reviewing extracted ASCII strings and examining the automated malicious score, it was possible to understand key characteristics of the sample without requiring full behavioral analysis. This approach is safe and effective for identifying potentially harmful executables.
