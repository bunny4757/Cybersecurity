#  WHOIS and NSLOOKUP Domain Information Gathering

## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to gather publicly available information about a domain using the whois command and to obtain DNS details and IP addresses using the nslookup tool.

## Tools Used
- Linux Terminal or Windows Git Bash  
- whois command  
- nslookup command  

## Steps Followed

### Step 1: Choose a Domain
A domain name was selected for analysis.  
Example: google.com  
(Replace with the domain you used.)

### Step 2: Run whois on the Domain
The following command was executed to gather domain registration details:
```
whois google.com
```
markdown
 

This command retrieved information such as:
- Domain registrar  
- Creation and expiration dates  
- Name servers  
- Organization details  
- DNSSEC status  



### Step 3: Perform a Basic nslookup Query
To obtain the domain's IP address, the following command was used:
```
nslookup google.com
```
 
 

The output included:
- Domain name  
- IPv4 and/or IPv6 address  
- DNS resolver used  

## Summary of Findings
The whois lookup provided ownership and registration information for the selected domain.  
The nslookup queries revealed the domain’s active IP address and DNS server configurations.  
Together, these tools demonstrated how domain and DNS information can be publicly accessed for analysis and troubleshooting.

## Conclusion
In this assignment, whois and nslookup were used to gather domain registration details and DNS information for a chosen domain. These tools are essential for understanding domain ownership, DNS configuration, and network troubleshooting. The results confirmed that both commands provide valuable insights into publicly accessible domain data.
